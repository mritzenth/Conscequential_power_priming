# Conscequential-power-priming
This power priming design is an adaptation of the design used in (Khademi et al., 2021), who that there are many problems associated with typical power priming (e.g. recalling or imagining a time when the participant was powerful), namely, demand effects. They offer to move forward with consequential priming.
In this design, the participant is put in a high-power position, while avatars endorse the role of neutral position (observer) and low-power positions (recipients). The participant is in charge of distributing 7 lottery tickets as they please among the 5 recipients. All avatars are personified with a name and age, in order to make the choice feel more consequential.
Each ticket has a 10% chance of winning. The participant will be made aware of the winner(s), and receive a message the winning avatar, thanking the participant for giving him the winning lottery ticket. Indeed, as gratitude is associated with low-power (Anicich et al., 2022), this comforts the avatars in the low-power position and the participant in the high-power position.
